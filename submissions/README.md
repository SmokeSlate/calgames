# Game submission intake files

This directory collects JSON payloads generated by the public submission form. Each file captures the
metadata supplied by the transferer so maintainers can review, test, and integrate new games into the main
library. Files are not published to the production site automaticallyâ€”they act as structured proposals.

Fields that appear in the JSON objects include:

- `title`, `author`, and `description` describing the game.
- Optional metadata such as `download`, `image`, `source`, and `fileUpload` entries.
- `transferer`, which stores the GitHub username of the person submitting the transfer request.
- `submittedAt`, `status`, and `submission` to help triage and track the request lifecycle.

The submission page creates one JSON file per request, names it with a timestamp and slug, and then opens a
pull request referencing the new file so reviewers can triage it quickly.
